# TradeBitcoin

Demo application written in Swift 5.1 using Xcode 11.3.1. Target OS is iOS 13.2.
Application downloads a list or currencies from server and shows sell/buy price Bitcoin/GBP.
It also allows entering order in units or currency (GBP).

## Suggestions

Implement price update when application is in background mode.
Form amount in currency format while entering amount in order text field e.g. 2,234.56 instead of 2234.56. 
Dynamically reduce font size in order text fields if value is too much or set maximum value or length.
